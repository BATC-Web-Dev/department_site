                    <h3>Local Server</h3>
                    <p>MAMP is pretty much the simplest, most robust local server we have found. We love it because you
                        can easily change your server destination files, installation is quick and easy, and the User
                        Interface is simple to understand and use. In the class room you will generally just use the
                        free version but when are ready to go pro the paid pro version of MAMP offers some significant
                        advantage but the biggest one is the ability to set it up to host multiple local hosts at one
                        time. Allowing you to easily start your projects for the day and keep everything tidy with its
                        own folder and location instead of having to move your files around constantly.
